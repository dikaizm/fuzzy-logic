# Fuzzy Logic

This repository contains a fuzzy logic system implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The system relies on several external libraries, and it is recommended to install them before running the notebook. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment and execute the fuzzy logic system.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running the Fuzzy Logic System

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dikaizm/fuzzy-logic.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fuzzy-logic
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `fuzzy.ipynb` notebook in your code editor.

5. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to see the fuzzy logic system in action.

   > Note: Ensure that you have an active Python kernel associated with your Jupyter Notebook.

Happy fuzzy logic experimenting! If you encounter any issues or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.
