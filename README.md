# Fuzzy Logic System

This repository contains a simple implementation of a fuzzy logic system using Python. The fuzzy logic system involves the use of membership functions, rules, and defuzzification to make decisions based on uncertain or imprecise input.

## Dependencies

To run this fuzzy logic system, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A powerful data manipulation library.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): A 2D plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): A statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.

## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Make sure to have Python and pip installed on your machine before running the command.

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuzzy-logic-system.git
cd fuzzy-logic-system
```

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

Explore the code and customize it based on your fuzzy logic system requirements.
